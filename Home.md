**[Argobots](http://www.argobots.org)**, which was developed as a part of the [Argo](http://www.argo-osr.org/) project, is a lightweight, low-level threading and tasking framework to support massive on-node parallelism. It provides high-level runtimes and domain-specific libraries with threading and tasking mechanisms so that they can build their solutions efficiently. Argobots supports two kinds of work units called user-level threads and tasklets. It also exposes hardware resources (e.g., cores or hardware threads) as execution streams (ESs) and provides mapping mechanisms between work units and ESs.
